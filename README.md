# Telco-Churn-ML

This repository contains a complete machine learning workflow for predicting customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, EDA, model training, evaluation, and explainability.

The goal is to build accurate classification models and compare their performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, precision/recall, and F1-score.
